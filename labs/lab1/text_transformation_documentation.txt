This DSL is a domain-specific language for cleaning and transforming text in a clear, declarative, and procedural way. 
It is designed to operate on text streams or files, keeping the syntax minimal while allowing powerful transformations.

The DSL lets you load text from an input file (LOAD "file.txt") and then apply a sequence of transformations such as 
replacing substrings, trimming whitespace, changing case, splitting and joining text, or applying formatting. 
These transformations are written one per line, making the scripts easy to read and predictable.

For example, you can write REPLACE "foo" WITH "bar" to rename occurrences of a substring, 
UPPERCASE to normalize everything to capital letters, or SPLIT BY "," followed by JOIN WITH ";" to reformat CSV-like data. 
The syntax avoids complexity, focusing on clarity and direct manipulation of text.

The DSL also provides commands for common preprocessing tasks:
-	Removing unwanted characters (TRIM).
-	Normalizing data for case-insensitive comparison (LOWERCASE, UPPERCASE).
-	Reformatting tokens by splitting and rejoining with different delimiters.
-	Saving the final output to a file with SAVE "output.txt".

This makes it especially useful for data cleaning, ETL pipelines, and quick scripting tasks, 
where you need to fix inconsistent text formats, standardize values, or prepare text before loading into another system.
